# Newsaliser
The idea behind this project is ultimately to provide an aggregated view on news articles, with an emphasis on sources, topics and the veracity thereof.

## What actually is it?
It's a web UI with a Neo4J + Postgres backend, which scrapes news articles, looks at the sources and topics present, and provides information about them.

# Deploying
Can be deployed on heroku with the Postgres, RedisToGo & GrapheneDB add-ons

## Features TODO

- add front end error handling
- Better topic extraction
- Better metadata extraction
- More statistics on an article/topic/domain level

## Contributing
Please get in touch if you come across this project, I am desperate for collaborators!
